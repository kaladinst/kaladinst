### Hi there, I'm Emir 👋

I'm a **3rd-year Computer Engineering student** (2nd Semester, 2.94 GPA) based in **Sakarya University, Turkey**. I focus on building scalable backend systems and exploring low-level game development.

My current goal is to ensure that I have a solid foundation and improve my skills to help the future organizations that I will be working with.

- 💻 I recently completed a **Chip-8 Emulator** in Java.
- 💻 I also completed a **Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduler** in C.
- 🌍 I worked on **Akıllı Küre (Smart Globe)**, an IoT project (Documentation & Repository coming soon).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Spring Boot** and **Distributed Systems**.
- 🎮 I’m interested in **Game Engine Architecture** and **System Programming**.
