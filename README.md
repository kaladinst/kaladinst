### Hi there, I'm Emir 👋

I'm a **3rd-year Computer Engineering student** (2nd Semester, 2.94 GPA) based in **Sakarya, Turkey**. I focus on building scalable backend systems and exploring low-level game development.

- 💻 I recently completed a **Chip-8 Emulator** in Java.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduler** in C.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Spring Boot** and **Distributed Systems**.
- 🎮 I’m interested in **Game Engine Architecture** and **System Programming**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also deeply into Mass Effect lore and modding!
